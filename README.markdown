gem_dependency_example
=======

An example gem that shows how to use the gem extension framework
to install gems on the user's system based on the Ruby version
the user has installed.

The gem_dep_example folder has the example with the proper
layout and annotated code. 

The other folders are the 
gems that will be loaded by gem_dep_example, the choice
of which depends if the user has Ruby 1.9 installed
or not.

The code is based on the example found in the
Ruby Programming/Ruby Gems wiki book.
